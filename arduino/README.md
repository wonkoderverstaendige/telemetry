# Libraries
To have shared libraries and platformio just being unwilling to be bent to
my directory structure, the lib folder must be linked to either the individual
project lib folders, or globally in the .platformio folder.

While the OneWire library can be installed via the platformio library manager,
the Telemetry specific stuff needs to be installed manually as its a private
library.
