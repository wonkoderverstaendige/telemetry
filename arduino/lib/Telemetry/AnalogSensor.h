//!  AnalogSensor class.
/*!
* Analog sensors read directly from the built-in ADC.
* Some sensors may require switching an auxiliary pin HIGH/LOW,
* for example the soil moisture sensor. Said sensor however shouldn't
* remain HIGH when not in use to reduce corrosion of the electrodes.
* Hence the additional logic to toggle pins as needed.
